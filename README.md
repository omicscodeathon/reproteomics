# Reproducible proteomics
The lack of reproducible science in proteomics analyses – a bioinformatics perspective

Objective and aims:
The objective of this literature review is to critically examine the challenges associated with the complexity and variability of available frameworks in proteomics analyses. Specifically, it aims to:
* Assess the extent and impact of inherent proteomics data analysis heterogeneity.
* Evaluate the role of non-standardized protocols and data analysis pipelines in contributing to the lack of reproducibility in proteomics research.
* Investigate the proposed solution of establishing community-wide efforts to develop standardized protocols and guidelines for data analysis in proteomics, with a focus on its feasibility, effectiveness, and adoption within the scientific community.
* Develop a recommended scoring system for reproducible proteomics frameworks.
By addressing these objectives, this literature review seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of the challenges and potential solutions related to reproducibility in proteomics research, offering insights into the current state of the field and avenues for improvement.
